      List of USB-C muxes and retimers for the USB-C port. The USB-C subsystem
      traverses this list in the order specified. The phandles are references to
      cros-ec,usbc-mux nodes. Link this mux chain with a specific USB-C port by
      adding the "cros-ec,usb-mux-chain" as a child of the "named-usbc-port"
      node.

# Example DTS defining USB-C port 0 with usb mux chain. The chain has two muxes:
# BB retimer and virtual mux.
#
#       usbc_port0: port0@0 {
#               compatible = "named-usbc-port";
#               reg = <0>;
#               ...
#               usb-mux-chain-0 {
#                       compatible = "cros-ec,usb-mux-chain";
#                       usb-muxes = <&usb_c0_bb_retimer
#                                    &virtual_mux_c0>;
#               };
#       };
